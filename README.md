# Instructions for launching application

-> download and unzip the project folder
-> if you have an IDE such as Visual Studio Code, open the folder up from there. IF NOT
-> launch the command prompt / terminal
-> CD into the 'ERP-Project' folder
-> type 'npm install'
-> after dependencies are installed, type 'npm start'
-> this should launch the application in a separate Chrome or Edge window
-> if you have GIT downloaded, you can just CD into the ERP-Project folder
and type 'git fetch'
-> that should update the application to the newest version
-> make sure to run 'npm install' after doing this before trying to run
the app again, in case new dependencies are being used.
